## 1. Login to AWS console.

## 2. Create IAM user for deployment

#with specific access

1. EC2 access : It is virtual machine

2. ECR: Elastic Container registry to save your docker image in aws


#Description: About the deployment

1. Build docker image of the source code

2. Push your docker image to ECR

3. Launch Your EC2 

4. Pull Your image from ECR in EC2

5. Lauch your docker image in EC2

#Policy:

2. AmazonEC2FullAccess

## 3. Create ECR repo to store/save docker image
- Save the URI: 730335610052.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mlproject

# 4. Create EC2 machine (Ubuntu)

# 5. Open EC2 and Install docker in EC2 Machine:

#optinal

sudo apt-get update -y
